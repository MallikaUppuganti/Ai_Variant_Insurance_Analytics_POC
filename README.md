### Domain: Financial Services

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) developed for a major client in the Insurance sector, designed to provide strategic visibility into revenue performance, sales opportunities and executive engagement.

As a Data Analyst, I led the end-to-end workflow, from raw data cleaning and transformation to designing a dynamic dashboards that empowers stakeholders with instant decision-making capability.

Built using Excel and Power BI, the dashboards help business leaders track KPIs, uncover performance gaps and drive data-informed decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
* Visualize sales performance across Cross Sell, New Business and Renewal categories

* Monitor target vs. achievement and uncover revenue shortfalls

* Identify top-performing account executives and operational bottlenecks

* Provide a centralized view of the sales funnel and engagement metrics
